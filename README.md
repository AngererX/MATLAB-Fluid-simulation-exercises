## Introduction

This is a repository where I store my fluid dynamics simulation practice files. The primary programming language used is MATLAB. The exercises covered include the following:

## 2D Lid-Driven Cavity Flow

This is a classic CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation problem, focused on solving the Navier–Stokes equations for a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. Here, we use **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to obtain the solution.
